### Details about the project

This project is a Vanilla JavaScript project called "Todo". In this project, I used Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Users can able to add a new to-do list by 
entering their to-do jobs inside the "add a new to-do" input. Then they can submit either with submit button or by pressing enter. Then a new to-do list will add 
to the DOM. Users can also delete the to-do lists by clicking the trash can icon from each to-do list. The "search todos" input field allows the users to be able to 
search the specific to-do list which they want to search from the whole list. This website is responsive in both desktop and mobile views.
